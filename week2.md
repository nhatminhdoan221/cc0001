## 3 things that interest me the most 
### 1. Why NTU always turn lots of lights at night when they can only turn on an amount of number which are necessary?
- Is this because it can show the symbol of safety? Security?
- Is this because people cannot do anything suspicious?
- Does it not waste the energy? Eventhough NTU use solar panels? Energy is something that should not be wasted and also can be traded?
### 2. The beauty of Circular Road
- It is peaceful at day time, while at night is really huzzling and buzzling.
- Even though, it is a place new the center, the Business District? Is not it should also be crowd and animated?
- Its simple beauty brings the inner peace like going on a vacation even in a busy place
- Why should it be the place that people coming to relax at night?
### 3. Is Singaporeans' Kiasu an other way people call FOMO?
- It is all like the feeling that people are scared that they do not know/ cannot get something?
- It is considered a bad culture?
- Happiness ranking of Singapore is 30th while its life expentency is 85 (1st) and HALE 73.6 (2nd) of the world?
- If the people can have a long-term life but their happiness cannot maximize, is it still a good choice?

## This interests to my Op-Ed
- It will surround Singaporeans' working, living culture
- On the aspect seems to be an alarm of mental and wellbeing aspects.

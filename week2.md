- After watching the video, note down:
+  10 things that you care about/are curious about
+ Pick 3 that interest you the most and do some writing
on why you find these things interesting. What is the
appeal factor?
+ Think about how these interests can influence your
choice of topic for the op-ed


**Think about your research topic in terms of (1) A
specific place in Singapore / (2) A community in
Singapore / (3) Your own writing practices across
different mediums.**

This Is What Inequality Looks Like (Teo, 2018)
1 If one is not paying attention, it is not immediately obvious when a block of flats is made up mostly
or entirely of rental units. But once you start paying attention, there are a few clues observable from
street level.

2 First, doors. The way to tell a block of rental flats is to look at the space between front doors. Rental
flats are either so-called 1-room or 2-room HDB flats. This means they have either no separate bedroom
or one bedroom respectively. 1-room flats have a living area, a kitchen, a bathroom; they have no
separate bedroom; they are roughly 35 square meters. 2-room flats have a living area, a kitchen, a
bathroom, and one bedroom; they are about 45 square meters. For comparison, HDB 4-room flats—
the modal type of housing in Singapore—are double the size at 90 square meters. Each rental flat is
thus relatively narrow and the doors in close proximity. Looking at the facade of a HDB rental block, one
is struck by the high density of units.

3 A second feature of rental flats that is striking is smells. 

- SMELLS

Many rental blocks I have visited, particularly
in older neighborhoods, have distinct and not entirely pleasant smells. 

- older neighborhoods
- -> not entire pleasant smells
  
It is difficult to say what the
smells are of, but again high density is at play here. The smells are accompanied by the sight of **trash** in
common areas—including abandoned mattresses and furnishings—and sometimes cat urine in
stairwells. The limited space within flats means people need to air clothes, mattresses, and upholstery
in corridors, and so damp textiles contribute to smells. One gets used to the smells and yet it never
leaves one’s consciousness entirely. 

-> What contribute to the smell ( high living density)

When I first started my fieldwork, it was one of the most salient (noi bat)
experiences of being in rental neighborhoods: my brain switched to fieldwork mode as the scents hit
my nostrils; if I had spent some weeks away, the smells brought me back to the memories and feelings
associated with that space and my work there. Taking the stairs, especially if there was cat pee, I found
myself holding my breath as I walked past.

-> smells can help you recognize and remember 




4 I do not think the trash/smell situation is there because rental-flat dwellers are inherently less capable
of taking care of their environments. Around Singapore, there are high-density areas where a great deal
of trash is generated. The reason many other areas remain clean is because there are many workers
doing the work of cleaning up. The point that strikes me here about smells is this: going home to these
smells is going into a space that is distinct, a little apart from other spaces in Singapore. Whether or not
it is thought of consciously, when a rental flat resident goes home, she or he enters into a zone marked
not only by the visual but also by something quite primal and physical.

-> the smell not because of the human behavior
-> everywhere also produce lots of trash -> other have more pp to clean
-> here is less people to do so.
-> the smell is signature, can determine where or what is this.


5 I did not feel unsafe when I was doing my fieldwork. Admittedly, I was initially wary. In retrospect, that
must have been because I too carried in my consciousness negative prejudices about low-income
neighborhoods. As happens with unfair biases, they are forced to retreat when confronted with
empirical realities and complexities. Once I met people who had been in prison or had gotten in trouble
with the law, they became full-fledged persons rather than caricatures. 

-> preconceptions 

Quite apart from what I carried
with me as preconceived notions about low-income persons, then, it was a third feature of rental
neighborhoods that perpetuated a sense of insecurity and danger, distrust and surveillance: the
presence of police, both literally and metaphorically. Compared to non-rental neighborhoods, one sees
police cars and policemen in rental neighborhoods more frequently. Residents also tell me that there
are always police as well as narcotics officers around. Signboards and posters in rental neighborhoods
are also constant reminders of the dangers lurking and the proximity of one’s everyday life to serious
problems.

-> see more police on rental house places, less secured "Signboards and posters in rental neighborhoods
are also constant reminders of the dangers lurking and the proximity of one’s everyday life to serious
problems."

6 There are probably empirically-sound reasons that the police and these signboards and posters exist
to a greater degree in rental neighborhoods than in other neighborhoods. Perhaps it is the case that
there are more incidences that require police attention here than in other neighborhoods (although it
also may be the case that it is easier to get caught for even minor transgressions here than in other
neighborhoods precisely because of police presence). 
--> pp get caught just because more polices?

Nonetheless, one has to wonder if it is necessary
to create such a palpable sense of danger and insecurity when the majority of this population are law-
abiding citizens. 

--> question for the appearance of the police even though pp obey the laws.

More poignantly, we should also ask, if the signs that we see in our everyday lives
contribute to our sense of who we are, and are indeed aimed at getting us to think about our behaviors
and habits, what are the implications for people when the only message they are getting about who
they are revolve around crimes and problems? For kids who grow up in these neighborhoods, in
particular, what are the effects of being surrounded by messages that remind them not to do this or
that?

final question -> for people grew up --> whats the impact of internalizing the,living in that, <--- living 
--> sense of identity 

how does this affect them <-- no answer, 
<<- doan nay cho context 


<<- how are they grew up 




police <- unsafe ,
do thw police need to be there
children <- impact on the children 
<- message you get, always reminded p
